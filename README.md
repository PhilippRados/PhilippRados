### Hi I'm Philipp ðŸ‘‹

I started to code in Python when I was 16 years old when I had no clue what the landscape even had to offer. I learned by reading some books and just writing fun small programs. My programming skills improved drastically as I coded every day for my software-internship in 10th grade. This also showed how me little I actually knew and how much there was still to learn in the vast software-world. I try to absorb as much information as I can from all different kinds of fields such as: AI / Machine Learning, Low Level C programming, Flutter App-development and many more

I also attended some Kaggle competitions just for fun: https://www.kaggle.com/docphilipp
