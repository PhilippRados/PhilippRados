### Hi I'm Philipp ðŸ‘‹
---
Currently I'm still going to school and only code in my free-time. I started to code in Python and now start to learn ML.
In some time in the future I also want to learn some C++ and make some fun projects there, but first I'm going to play around using Neural Nets etc.
When I'm done with school in one year I'll will probably attend University and want to code more professionally...
